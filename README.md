# Introducing The PANDA-9000

The PANDA 9000 should probably be a set of Grunt plugins or something. Basically, I'm finding that, for every project, I'm repeating certain patterns. We always have a Patchboard server, we always have a static file server (at least for development), we always need to build HTML and CSS files with Nice, and so on.

Rather than continue to cut-and-paste away, I figured the next most obvious thing to do was to put all this stuff in a repo with a package.json so we can reference it via Git tags. From there, we may promote some of these things into various kinds of NPMs.
